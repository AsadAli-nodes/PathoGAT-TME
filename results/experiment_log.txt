EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS LOG
========================
1. GNN (Baseline)
   - Overall: 51.61%
   - Weakness: Overfits to Tumor (86%), ignores Stroma.

2. GAT (Weighted)
   - Overall: 58.18% (BEST)
   - Strength: Excellent Immune detection (63%).

3. GATv2 (Morphology-Aware)
   - Overall: 57.73%
   - Strength: Best Stroma detection (57.35%) and best class balance.
   - Note: Lower loss (1.03) indicates better convergence than GAT (1.10).
